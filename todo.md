# To-Do list

Very Distant:

[ ] Titan AI using RAA

[ ] Warhammer radial spikes and large spike :sob: (remember to add them to Founding)

[ ] The Vow :scream:???//??////??/???


Less Distant:

[ ] Warhammer pickaxe and durability


Bugs / High priority:

[x] Investigate Founding and Beast last shifts

[x] Attack hardened knuckles tomfoolery

[x] Colossal stack permanently increases KB

[x] Founding Warhammer doesn't have aoe spikes

[x] Stacks aren't *ever* removed if lose stacks on death is false

[x] Warhammer crossbow doesn't go away ? :sob: (turns out it was only the Founding's)

[x] Founding colossal can't nuke in multiplayer

[x] Non-player pures can steal titans

[x] Titan stealing like lowkey doesn't work for some reason? Desync issues, only on stack
