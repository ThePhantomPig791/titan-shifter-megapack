# To-Do list

[ ] Titan AI using RAA

[ ] Warhammer radial spikes and large spike :sob: (remember to add them to Founding)

[ ] The Vow :scream:???//??////??/???


[ ] Utilize the new Appli power to make titans unable to pick up items

[ ] Change regain shifts timer to use a resource instead of the delay action

[ ] Increase high shift overlay strength because that apparently makes it work

[ ] Bring the apugli hide nametag power into a seperate, assigned power

[ ] Look into (and hopefully fix) the 1.20.2 origin screen bugs
