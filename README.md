# Titan Shifter Megapack
## A 1.20 Minecraft Origins datapack that adds Titan Shifters from [Attack on Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan) as origins!
### Requires [Origins](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins), [Pehkui](https://modrinth.com/mod/pehkui), [Apugli](https://modrinth.com/mod/apugli), [Appli](https://modrinth.com/mod/appli), and most likely [(X)XL packets](https://modrinth.com/mod/xxl-packets)



All of the titans have individual stats and unique abilities, including crystal hardening for the Attack, climbing walls and ceilings as the Jaw, and emitting deadly steam for the Colossal!

You can read more about the pack on the [wiki](https://tsmp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and you can come chat about it on my [discord](https://discord.gg/gwnfUCEXBx).
