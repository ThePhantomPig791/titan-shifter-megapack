A *little* (seriously, less than a function's worth) bit of code from (most notably the Attack Titan's crystal): user_NULL#3958
Idea/inspiration/motivation: user_NULL#3958 + Valy#0662, AKA TheKattInTheHat (AKA @the_valy because of new discord usernames)
The rest of the coding: ThePhantomPig791#0003 (AKA @phantompig also because of the username thing) (who is also me lmao)
