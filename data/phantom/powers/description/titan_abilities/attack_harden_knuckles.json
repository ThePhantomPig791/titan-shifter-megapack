    "description": "In titan form, you can harden your knuckles and hands to deal extra damage for your next few punches. On your first shift, you'll get ten hardened punches, but on your second, you'll only get eight. Punching mobs or non-Titans won't \"use\" a punch. Punching anything armored will count as an extra punch, so hitting the Armored Titan, for example, will \"use\" two punches. With your knuckles hardened, you can also sneak and punch to cause a mini explosion, \"using\" two punches in the process.",
