    "description": "If you die in titan form while near a transformed Female Titan, you'll go berserk, creating a huge, fiery explosion in the process. In berserk mode, you are constantly on fire, immune to fire damage, smaller, have higher speed and strength, but lower health. You cannot untransform in berserk mode, but after 50 seconds, you'll be ejected, gaining debuffs, lowering your energy, and leaving behind a charred skeleton."
